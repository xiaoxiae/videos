1
00:00:00,116 --> 00:00:04,254
Deep in the twisting maze of Minos, a lone Theseus seeks the mighty Minotaur.

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:10,010
After endless days of fruitless searching, Theseus locks eyes with the Minotaur in one of the maze’s many corridors.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,396
The enraged Minotaur lets out a guttural howl a starts moving towards him.

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,766
This is rather unfortunate news,

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,618
because Theseus forgot his sword at home

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,655
and so his only option is to run away from the much faster but not very intelligent Minotaur.

7
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,891
Can he get out before he is caught?

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,911
Before solving this question,

9
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:30,647
let’s start by looking at a simple version where there is no Minotaur.

10
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:34,734
You might recognize this as one of the fundamental problems in computer science,

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,720
that is, finding the shortest path.

12
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,974
There are a number of algorithms that can help us solve this problem,

13
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,993
the simplest one being Breadth-first Search (or BFS for short).

14
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,830
The idea behind BFS is the following:

15
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:50,517
we have a queue of states to explore, starting with the initial one.

16
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,205
In this problem, the set of states (formally the state space)

17
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:56,740
are the positions Theseus can move to.

18
00:00:57,707 --> 00:01:00,427
Each round, we’ll take a state from the queue,

19
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,747
add its undiscovered neighbouring states to the queue and repeat,

20
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:06,433
until the queue is either empty or we found what we’re looking for.

21
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,036
Speeding this up a bit,

22
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,126
we see that the algorithm indeed finds the shortest path.

23
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,381
From the visualizations, the algorithm seems intuitive,

24
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,266
but let’s actually try to implement it in Python.

25
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,020
The input will be a list of strings containing the rows of the maze.

26
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,540
We’ll need to extract the positions of Theseus and the escape,

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,242
which are denoted as T and E,

28
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:33,343
so let’s add some code to do that.

29
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,697
Now if you’ve never implemented BFS

30
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,232
then what to do next isn’t all that clear.

31
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,752
This can happen quite often when coding something new,

32
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:45,672
and a good way to overcome this is to write small functions

33
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,940
that seem like they could be useful.

34
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,608
For example,

35
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,810
we can write an is_position_valid function

36
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,546
that returns True if the position can be moved to

37
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,965
(i.e. is within the maze and isn’t a wall).

38
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,102
From the decription of the algorithm,

39
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,989
we’ll also need a next_states function that returns the neighbouring states of a given state.

40
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,427
The function will check each direction (left, right, up and down),

41
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:11,097
and if the new state is valid, it will be added to the list, which is returned at the end.

42
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:15,435
Given these two small functions, we can tackle the BFS itself

43
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:18,004
It will take two arguments:

44
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,739
a starting state and a stop condition,

45
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:24,527
which will be a function that takes in a state and returns True if it’s an ending one,

46
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:26,196
so the algorithm knows when to stop searching.

47
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,948
You might be thinking that this is a bit pointless,

48
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,970
since we could just pass the position of the escape and check against it when running the algorithm

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,904
and while this is true,

50
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,809
this way allows us to support more complex ways of ending the BFS like multiple escape tiles.

51
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,846
As we’ve previously discussed,

52
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:45,265
the algorithm uses a queue of states to explore,

53
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,232
beginning with the starting
one.

54
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,154
To record the states that we’ve already discovered and don’t want to add to the queue again,

55
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,138
we’ll use Python’s built-in set.

56
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:58,061
The rest of the function essentially writes itself from the way we previously described the algorithm:

57
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,746
while the queue isn’t empty,

58
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,781
we’ll take a state from the queue,

59
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,934
check the stop condition (possibly reporting a solution)

60
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,487
and add its undiscovered neighbouring states to the queue,

61
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,856
marking them discovered to not add them to the queue again.

62
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,811
Finally, if we didn’t find an ending state after exploring all of them,

63
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,312
we’ll report that no solution exists.

64
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,249
Implemented like this,

65
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,601
the algorithm is... well... useless,

66
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,970
because it just reports that the solution exists,

67
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,121
not what it actually looks like.

68
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,408
We’d ideally like to see the path that Theseus took,

69
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,526
and for that we’ll need to slightly modify our code.

70
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:34,280
Instead of just recording that we discovered a state,

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,350
we’ll remember from which state it was discovered so we can later backtrack.

72
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:38,851
To do this,

73
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,205
we’ll use a dictionary instead of a set for storing discovered states,

74
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,425
with the keys being states themselves and values their predecessors

75
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,878
Since the initial state doesn’t have a predecessor,

76
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:49,646
we’ll make it None.

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,265
When discovering a new state,

78
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,816
we’ll make sure to remember its predecessor.

79
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,053
Finally, we can add the backtracking code.

80
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,423
There isn’t anything too complicated here –

81
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:03,977
we start with the ending state and while it has a predecessor,

82
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,812
we’ll move to it and append it to the path.

83
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,382
Finally, we print the path in reverse,

84
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,051
because we’d like it printed from start to end, not the other way around.

85
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,871
One small note here:

86
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:18,408
for clarity of code, I wanted to exclude importing libraries,

87
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,043
so I used a list as a queue here.

88
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,063
That is a terrible idea, because popping from the beginning takes linear time.

89
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:29,502
In practice, you should use Python collections module and its deque class,

90
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,771
which has a popleft operation that is constant.

91
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:38,011
Now we can finally call the BFS function  with Theseus’ starting position

92
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,381
and a stop condition that returns True if the given state is the escape.

93
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:46,019
And, as we see, Theseus can indeed escape this particular maze.

94
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,760
Let’s get back to the original problem.

95
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,847
For every move Theseus makes (left, right, up and down),

96
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:58,614
the Minotaur makes two.

97
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,785
Fortunately, the Minotaur isn’t particularly bright

98
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:05,104
and so it always moves directly towards Theseus,

99
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,239
wherever  he is in the maze.

100
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:10,526
He does this by first checking if he can move closer horizontally,

101
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:11,995
and if this is not the case

102
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,963
then he will try to do so vertically,

103
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:14,580
repeating twice.

104
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,252
Here are a few simulated moves for this particular configuration.

105
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,746
Try to pause here for a minute and think about how we could approach this seemingly more difficult problem.

106
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,951
The key idea is the following

107
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:37,837
in the previous task, the state was the position of Theseus.

108
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,792
Now, the state becomes a pair of positions of Theseus and the Minotaur.

109
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,463
In terms of their validity, they must be outside of the wall

110
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:50,867
and, additionally, Theseus’ position can’t equal Minotaur’s

111
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,085
because he would be dead.

112
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,237
Notice, however,

113
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,606
that the problem fundamentally didn’t change –

114
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,909
we still have a state which we can use to
generate neighbouring states

115
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,244
and thus again use BFS.

116
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,099
Luckily, the way we wrote the function BFS was very general –

117
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,851
it doesn’t care about Theseus or the Minotaur;

118
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:11,371
it just takes an initial state and a stop condition,

119
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,605
whatever they might be,

120
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,376
and repeatedly adds and explores neighbouring states via the next_states function,

121
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,878
meaning that we c an reuse it to solve ourMinotaur problem.

122
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,565
For starters, let’s add the Minotaur to the maze.

123
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,869
We’ll have to find it, so let’s add some code to do that.

124
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,923
Although the BFS function doesn’t change,

125
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,258
the way we call it does,

126
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,178
since the state is now a (theseus, minotaur) tuple

127
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:38,531
and the stop condition only checks if Theseus escaped, not the Minotaur.

128
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,118
We’ll also rename the next_states function,

129
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:45,088
because now it only returns the next possible positions of Theseus.

130
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,257
To properly implement next_states,

131
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,860
we’ll first need a function that moves the Minotaur towards Theseus.

132
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,145
To do this,

133
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:55,665
we’ll write a small function that moves the Minotaur in just one dimension,

134
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,900
returning +1, 0 or -1.

135
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,721
Here are a few examples of what it returns for specific input values.

136
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:10,680
The main function for Minotaur movement then uses this function to attempt to move closer to Theseus horizontally

137
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,783
and, if not successful, vertically, repeating twice.

138
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,772
With these two functions, we can finally write next_states:

139
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,890
given some state,

140
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,210
Theseus attempts to move in all directions and Minotaur follows suit.

141
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:28,164
If he catches Theseus, the state is invalid, else it’s fine.

142
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,685
Running the code now, we see that the path is quite a bit longer.

143
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:37,423
Before visualizing it, try to pause here and solve the problem yourself –

144
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,191
what should Theseus do?

145
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:45,965
It turns out that Theseus has to lead the Minotaur into a corner to gain additional distance and only then escape,

146
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,999
but escape he does.

147
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,054
This is very exciting –

148
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,508
we implemented a general algorithm to solve problems that have states

149
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,577
where the
goal is to get from one to another

150
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,262
in the least amount of steps possible,

151
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,813
like the shortest path problem

152
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,148
and Theseus and the Minotaur problem.

153
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,370
Now you might say that this algorithm is only useful for problems that involve a 2D board,

154
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,337
but this is not the case.

155
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,273
To convince you otherwise,

156
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,190
here is a 3D board...

157
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,692
nono, just kidding;

158
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:16,445
here is a really fun problem taken from the Advent of Code 2022, day 19.

159
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,015
There are 4 types of robots,

160
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:21,384
each producing one of the following resources:

161
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,986
ore, clay, obsidian and geode.

162
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,406
Each robot produces one resource per minute

163
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,159
(so if you have 4 ore robots, they produce 4 ore a minute).

164
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,547
Besides this, you have a factory that can build a new robot in one minute:

165
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:37,133
the ore robot costs 4 ore

166
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,985
the clay robot costs 2 ore

167
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,320
the obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay

168
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,522
and the geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian

169
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,692
The factory takes a whole minute building the robot,

170
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,411
meaning that during a minute,

171
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,498
the factory first subtracts the resources required to build the robot,

172
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,067
the robots then produce their respective resources

173
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,269
and finally the robot is finished

174
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,039
We start with an ore robot and no resources.

175
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,009
By building the robots in a specific order,

176
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,312
we want to maximize the number of geodes produced after the first 24 minutes.

177
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:11,150
For these costs of the robots, here is the optimal solution.

178
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,296
As you can see, the maximum number of geodes is 9.

179
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:27,917
Pause here and think of what the states are and how to get from one to another.

180
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:33,356
The states are the current number of resources and robots,

181
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:34,724
but also the time,

182
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,309
since we have to know when to stop exploring.

183
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:41,464
Getting from one state to another always means increasing the time by one,

184
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:43,132
adding the acquired resources

185
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,884
and attempting to build all possible robots.

186
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:51,540
This solution works but wouldn’t terminate in a reasonable amount of time because of the branching factor,

187
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,192
which is the average number of neighbouring states.

188
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:57,947
When going from the starting state (which is an ore robot and no resources),

189
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,299
the problem doesn’t branch
too much initially,

190
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,451
but the more resources are acquired,

191
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,420
the more options there are,

192
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,790
so getting to depth 24 of this tree will take a very long time,

193
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,358
since it has around 21 million states.

194
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,361
So is the problem entirely hopeless?

195
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,615
Well, no, there are a few things we can do,

196
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,450
namely pruning and prioritization.

197
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,201
Let’s first look at pruning.

198
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,824
Pruning is the technique of removing valid states from the search that you know aren’t going to lead to the right solution.

199
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,195
For example, let’s think about a branch where only ore robots are built.

200
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,064
It certainly is a valid branch,

201
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,200
but we know that it won’t produce the correct result,

202
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,803
because building more ore robots than what’s the highest requirement for ore is pointless.

203
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,124
We can therefore remove this branch and others like it to speed up the algorithm.

204
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,593
As another example,

205
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:47,113
when we finally find states that obtain some geodes,

206
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,999
we can start ignoring other states that couldn’t obtain more

207
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,118
even if they build a geode robot every minute,

208
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,069
achieving further speedup.

209
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,206
While these strategies do help, as the graphs show,

210
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:58,424
we can do even better

211
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,509
and for that, let’s go back to the shortest path problem.

212
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,013
Remember that to solve it, we used BFS,

213
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,499
which uses a queue to process states in the order they were discovered.

214
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,721
However, it might be a good idea to first explore (i.e. “prioritize”)

215
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,506
states that look more promising than others.

216
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,908
In this maze, for example,

217
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,395
states that are closer to the escape (in terms of their (x, y) coordinates)

218
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,897
should probably be explored before those that are further,

219
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:23,916
because there is a higher chance that they will lead to the escape.

220
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,937
This is what the A* algorithm does –

221
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,674
it uses a priority queue to prioritize states based on a heuristic function,

222
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:34,410
which is an estimate of how far the state is from the end

223
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,878
(in our case, the (x, y) distance).

224
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,997
I won’t go into detail here

225
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,383
but if you’re interested in an in-depth look at A*,

226
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:43,636
here is a fantastic video from my friends at Polylog that you should definitely watch.

227
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,874
Anyway, here is what happens when we use A* for our shortest path problem.

228
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:57,983
Pretty awesome, right?

229
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,406
And here is what happens when we use it on our robots problem, in combination with pruning.

230
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,159
Only 400 000 states – amazing.

231
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,731
The heuristic here is preferring states that have more rare resources

232
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,217
(so first geode, then obsidian, then clay and finally ore).

233
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:21,440
There is one last thing I want to cover before the video ends –

234
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,442
what if distances between the states weren’t equal?

235
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,327
In the problems we’ve seen,

236
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,080
it took exactly step to get from one state to another,

237
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,381
but this isn’t always the case.

238
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,752
Say you wanted to find the shortest path in a maze like this

239
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,186
where you’re allowed to break the wall,

240
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,605
but it takes you 10 steps while regular moves take just 1.

241
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,560
Intuitively, we’d still like to use BFS, but now there is a problem –

242
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,515
the order in which the states are added to the queue no longer corresponds to the distance from the start

243
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,634
because getting through the wall takes much longer.

244
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:54,156
To fix it, we’ll replace the regular queue with a priority queue (similar to A*)

245
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,125
to always visit the state that is closest to the start.

246
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,228
Here is the implementation, side by side with the BFS implementation.

247
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,632
As you can see, the algorithms are very similar with only a few differences.

248
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,735
Dijkstra uses a heap instead of the deque,

249
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,271
which is a data structure that can quickly return its smallest element.

250
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,342
It uses it to always explore the element that is closest from the start.

251
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:18,464
The next_states function has to be aware that different neighbouring states can have different distances

252
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,983
and so it has to return both the neighbour and the distance to it.

253
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:25,621
The distance from the start to the neighbour is the distance from start to the current state,

254
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,389
plus the distance from the current state to the neighbour.

255
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:33,112
A given state can be discovered by multiple states with different distances before it is finally explored,

256
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,131
so we have to add it to the heap every time we find a way to get to it quicker.

257
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,785
To do this, we track the distances to each state using a dictionary.

258
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:46,325
There is a more efficient implementation that doesn’t require adding it to the heap multiple times but is beyond the scope of this video.

259
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,945
Solving our crowded maze problem,

260
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,469
here is the shortest path,

261
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,656
breaking 4 walls in total and taking exactly 69 steps.

262
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:01,073
Nice.

263
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:03,609
And, as you might be thinking,

264
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,395
since the core principle of BFS and Dijkstra are the same,

265
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:09,782
we can again use A* to prioritize states that are closer to the escape,

266
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,983
solving the problem in fewer steps.

267
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,878
This is the end of the video.

268
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:26,665
I hope it gave you the necessary tools for solving state space problems of all shapes and sizes.

269
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:30,669
If you have an interesting one that you’d like to share or you feel like I missed something,

270
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,370
let me know in the comments.
